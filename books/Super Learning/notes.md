# Main Takeaways

* Always takes notes, but several different note taking strategies exists. The book suggests the Cornell method.
* Read any material as if you should teach it
* Always question what you are learning i.e. learning should be active not passive
* A main contributor to making new information stick is trying to recall it. Reading something will not make it stick but recalling it several time after will. Don't reread, try to recall the best you can before reading again.
* Make learning secondary! Setup problems to solve that require you to learn the material instead.
* Human attention span is limited. Having study sessions between 30-50 min followed by a small break is ideal.
* Prioritize understanding an comprehension over memorization 
* Always put new information into a context i.e. related it to some existing information that you already have.
* Learning is uncomfortable sometimes and failure is part of the process.
* Failure is something that brings you closer to success. 



## Chapter 2. Memory retention

* Learning relies on memory, and memory is the interplay between storing and retrieving information. Three steps encoding, storing and retrieval.
    * Information can be retrieved in a few ways. Recall it directly (no cues), recognition i.e. remembering after a cue, and relearning (which is the least effective)
* To cement memories practice retrieval as this is the most effective
* Spaced repetition is good for practicing retrieval and countering forgetting

### The Study Cycle
The study cycle is a process to follow that maximizes learning. It consists of
1. Preview
2. Attend
3. Review
4. Study 
5. Assess
start over.


## Chapter 3. Active Learning Techniques
* Active and conscious engagement with new material
* Most conventional learning techniques such as, lectures, reading and rereading, highlighting, and so on, are poor.
* The most effective techniques are self-explanation, interleaved practice (learning multiple skills at a time), elaborative interrogation and so on. 
* elaborative interrogation uses why and how questions to ensure an in-depth understanding.
* self-explanation uses self teaching i.e. explaining concepts to your self (Always read material as if you should teach it)
* Always check if you can explain a concepts to find gaps in understanding
* interleaved practice goes against common norms and advices you to alternate between different topics to strengthen connection and develop a cognitive agility.
* Focus on depth rather than surface understanding. Focus on understanding concepts rather than remembering facts.

## Chapter 4. Make Learning Secondary
* If learning becomes a result of trying to solve a problem it will be easier and faster.
* We are more likely to reach our learning goals if we are driven by a deeper desire than just "I want to learn". We can be motivated by
    * Explanation - why does something happpen'
    * Interpretation
    * Application - How can i use this knowledge
    * Perspective - How else can i look at this
    * Empathy - How is this other person looking at it
    * Self-knowledge - Who am I

* Problem based learning is a way of focusing on real world application of knowledge.
* Gamification - Can make learning more fun and desireable and make learning accidental. It can, however not replace a deeper desire. 

## Chapter 5. Teaching to learn
* Tackling learning with the mindset that you will have to teach it will improve your understanding as you take more responsibility for your learning. You will easily find holes in your understanding when you consider how you would teach it.
   * Students how are tutoring learn significantly more than those who are not.
* Good feedback is an important part of the learning process. It is specific and has to be given as fast as possible after some task.
* Ask questions before, during and after learning
* The PQ4R method - preview, question, read, reflect, recite and review. These steps allow you to engage with some material beyond the shallow levels. 

## Chapter 6. Mistakes in Learning
* Lazy reading i.e. reading where you don't engage with the material.
* It can be a mistake to assume you have a learning style when little scientific work support this (we all have a preference). Instead you should use a little of all the different learning styles.
* Better to adapt the learning process according to your learning style i.e. abstract vs. concrete, sequential vs. random.
* Lazy note taking is passive and fails to produce lasting learning. The Cornell note taking strategy is better.
* A good note taking strategy also includes note editing, note analysis and note reflection.
* All learning is trial and error. Not everything works.
