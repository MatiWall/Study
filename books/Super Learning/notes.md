# Main Takeaways

* Always takes notes, but several different note taking strategies exists. The book suggests the Cornell method.
* Read any material as if you should teach it
* Always question what you are learning i.e. learning should be active not passive
* A main contributor to making new information stick is trying to recall it. Reading something will not make it stick but recalling it several time after will. Don't reread, try to recall the best you can before reading again.
* Human attention span is limited. Having study sessions between 30-50 min followed by a small break is ideal.
* Prioritize understanding an comprehension over memorization 
* Always put new information into a context i.e. related it to some existing information that you already have.
* Learning is uncomfortable sometimes and failure is part of the process.
* Failure is something that brings you closer to success. 



## Chapter 2. Memory retention

* Learning relies on memory, and memory is the interplay between storing and retrieving information. Three steps encoding, storing and retrieval.
    * Information can be retrieved in a few ways. Recall it directly (no cues), recognition i.e. remembering after a cue, and relearning (which is the least effective)
