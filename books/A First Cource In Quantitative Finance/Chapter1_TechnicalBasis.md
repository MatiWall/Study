The power set $2^{\Omega}$ is the set of all subesets of $\Omega$ that can be constructed. There are $2^{\#\Omega}$ possible subsets.

For uncountable infinite set like $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$ is too large, instead one uses the $\sigma-\text{algebra}$ generated by all open intervals $(a, b)$ in \mathbb{R} for $a<b$. This is known as the Borel-$\sigma$-algebra ($\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$). From the definition of the $\sigma$-algebra this containe way more than just he open intervals. All sets than can be generated from open, half open and closed intervals are in the Bores-$\sigma$-algebra. For example sets like $(a,c)^C = (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty)$ and the set generated by 
$$ \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty (a-\frac{1}{n}, b+\frac{1}{n})=[a, b] $$

> **Open and Closed Sets** A set is oppen if for every point in the set there is a small negboring region that is also in the set. For example $(a,b)$ is an open aset as it includes all points between $a$ and $b$ and the endpoints are not included. Also $x\gt5$ is an open set whereas $x\ge 5$ is a closed set.
