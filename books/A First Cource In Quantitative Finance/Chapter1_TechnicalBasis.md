# Propability and Measure

<div style="color: red">go back and take notes from begining untill equation 2.4 (first quick calculation)</div>

The power set $2^{\Omega}$ is the set of all subesets of $\Omega$ that can be constructed. There are $2^{\#\Omega}$ possible subsets.

For uncountable infinite set like $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$ is too large, instead one uses the $\sigma-\text{algebra}$ generated by all open intervals $(a, b)$ in \mathbb{R} for $a<b$. This is known as the Borel-$\sigma$-algebra ($\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$). From the definition of the $\sigma$-algebra this containe way more than just he open intervals. All sets than can be generated from open, half open and closed intervals are in the Bores-$\sigma$-algebra. For example sets like $(a,c)^C = (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty)$ and the set generated by 
$$ \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty (a-\frac{1}{n}, b+\frac{1}{n})=[a, b] $$
Here for every point chosen arbitary close to the left of $a$ or to the right of $b$ an $n$ can be chosen such that this point in not in the set i.e. it becomes a closed set from $a$ to $b$.

> **Why intersection and not Limit**
> Limit is not a valid approch in set theory.

> **Open and Closed Sets** A set is oppen if for every point in the set there is a small negboring region that is also in the set. For example $(a,b)$ is an open aset as it includes all points between $a$ and $b$ and the endpoints are not included. Also $x\gt5$ is an open set whereas $x\ge 5$ is a closed set.

Consider the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the throw of a die where we are only interested in wether the number on top is even or odd. The sigma algebra generated by this is $$\mathcal{F} = \{\emptyset, A, A^C, \Omega\}$$ where $A = \{2, 4, 6\}$ and $A^C = \{1,3,5\}$. In general a $\sigma$-algebra generated by the event $A$ is $\mathcal{F} = \{\emptyset, A, A^C, \Omega\}$ also denoted $\mathcal{F}=\sigma(A)$, which is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containint $A$.

A function $\mu: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+_0$ with properties:
1. $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
2. $\mu \left(\bigcup_{n=1}^m A_n \right) = \Sigma_{n=1}^m \mu(A_n)$ for $A_1, A_2,... \in \mathcal{F}$ and $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for $i\neq j$

> Note: $\mathbb{R}^+_0$  represents the set of all non negative numbers $\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x \ge 0\}$. It could also have been like $\mathbb{R}^+_2$ which would be $\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x \ge 2\}$

$\mu$ is called a measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$. The triplet $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ is called a measure space (sometimes also proppability triplet). A measure is the most natural concept of a length assigned to all sets in the $\sigma$-algebra.
> Note: Consider the measurable space $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$ with the Borel-$\sigma$-algebra generated by all half open intervals $(a, b]$ for $a \le b$ and choosing the Lebesgue-measure $\mu((a, b]) = b-a$

In propaility theory one assigns the overall length $\mu(\Omega) = 1$ to $\Omega$. The associated measure is called probability and is abbreviated $P(A)$ for $A \in \mathcal{F}$. The triplet $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ is called the probability space.

# Filtrations and the Flow of Information 
Consider tossing a two ,times in succession. The outcomes can be labeled $$\Omega = \{(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)\}$$. Inventing the variable $t$ to track occurred number of tosses this can take values $t \in \{0, 1, 2\}$. We then ask, what is the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}_t$ generated by the coin tossing at $t$. At $t=0$ $$\mathcal{F}_0 = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$$ 
> **Empty set and Sample Space**: The empty set and sample space are included in the $\sigma$-algebra for consistency. It ensures that the $\sigma$-algebra is closed under complement and countable unions. $\sigma$-algebras are used to structure the sets on which you can define measures or probabilities. Including the empty set and the sample space ensures that the $\sigma$-algebra adheres to the necessary mathematical properties and can be used consistently in probability and measure theory.

Assuming that the first toss is $H$ we know that the event $A=\{(H, H), (H, T)\}$ has happened at $t=1$. Adding the required unions and complement to obtains $$ \mathcal{F}_1 = \{\emptyset, \{(H, T), (H, H)\}, \{(T, T), (T, H)\}, \Omega\}$$

>**Complement**: Taking the complement means creating a new set with all the elements that are not in the original set. <br> 
Given a universal set $U$ and a subset $A \subseteq U$ the complement is given $$A^C = \{x \in U \mid x \notin A\}$$ i.e. $A^c$ consists of all elements not in $A$. <br>
In probability theory $P(A^c)=1-P(A)$ 

By comparing $\mathcal{F}_0$ and $\mathcal{F}_1$ we see that the finer the partition of the $\sigma$-algebra the more information is revealed by the history of the process. Also $\mathcal{F}_0 \subset \mathcal{F}_1$ indicating that no information is forgotten. $\mathcal{F}_t$ captures the information up until $t$ and $\mathcal{F}_{t-1} \subset \mathcal{F}_t$ indicated that no information is lost.  

Considering the final toss we are able to say exactly which events happened or not like $(T, T)$ or $(H, T)$ i.e. $\mathcal{F}_2$ has the finest possible partition structure. Generating the $\sigma$-algebra by taking countable unions and complements you get the power set $$\mathcal{F}_2 = 2^\Omega$$
