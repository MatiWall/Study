# Chapter 2
## 2.1
Consider a simplified version of the wheel of fortune as seen in the figure. Consider that the wheel is fair. Create a complete probability space as a model for one turn of the wheel

### Solution
A probability space needs a sample space $\Omega$, a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ and the probability measure $P$.
Here we have 
$$
\Omega = {1,2,3},
$$
$$
\mathcal{F}={\emptyset, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, \Omega}
$$
$$
P(\{\omega\})=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{4} & \text{for } \omega \in \{1,2\} \\
\frac{1}{2} & \text{for } \omega = 3
\end{cases}
$$

## 2.2
Calculate the natural filtration from exercise 2.1, generated by the outcome $A=\{2\}. Does \mathcal{F}_1 = 2^\Omega$ hold?
