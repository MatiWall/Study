# Quick calculation 
## 2.1
Verify that for $A_1, A_2\in \mathcal{F}$ the intersection $A_1 \cap A_2$ is also in $\mathcal{F}$
## Solution
A $\sigma$-algebra is defined as:
1. $\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty
2. if $A\in \mathcal{F}$ then $A^C\in \mathcal{F}$
3. if $A_1, A_2,\ldots \in \mathcal{F}$ then $\cup_{n=1}^{N}A_n \in \mathcal{F}$

From definition 2 we know that $A_1^C$ and $A_2^C$ are also in $\mathcal{F}$ and from 3. that $A_1^C \cup A_2^C \in \mathcal{F}$. From the De Morgan's rule we know
$$
    \cap_{n=1}^{N}A_n = \left(\cup_{n=1}^N A_n^C\right)^C
$$
we see that  $A_1 \cap A_2 \in \mathcal{F}$

# 2.2
Considering a die throw where all that matters to us is if the number on top is even or odd. The sigma algebra generated by this is $$\mathcal{F} = \{\emptyset, \{2, 4, 6\}, \{1,3,5\}, \Omega\}$$ where
$\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.
Verify that $\mathcal{F}$ is a valid $\sigma$-algebra.

**Condition 1: Non Empty** - Obviously not (Fulfilled).

**Condition 2: Complement** - Consider the even numbers $A=\{2, 4, 6\}$, $A^C$ will then be the odd numbers as seen from definition of $\Omega$ and vise versa.

**Condition 3: Countable Unions** - Say we have $A_1 = \{1, 3, 5\}$ and $A_2 = \{2,4,6\}$ the union $A_1 \cup A_2 = \Omega$ i.e. this is also in the $\sigma$-alegbra. Also any union of $A_n$ with $\emptyset$ returns $A_n$ i.e. in the set.

# 2.3
Convince yourself that the natural filtration generated by observing the events $A_1=\{(H, H), (H, T)\}$ and $A_2={(H, T)}$ has only eight elements.

>**Natural Filtration** - A filtration is a family of $\sigma$-algebras $\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t \ge 0}$ indexed by time, where each $\mathcal{F}_t$ represents the information available up to time $t$. A filtration is called natural if it is generated by the stochastic process itself.

Starting by listing all sets

$\mathcal{F}_0 = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$

$\mathcal{F}_1 = \{\emptyset,\{(H, H), (H, T)\}, \{(T, T), (T, H)\}, \Omega\}$

1. $\emptyset$
2. $\Omega = \{(H, H), (H, T), (T, T), (T, H)\}$
3. $A_1 = \{(H, H), (H, T)\}$
4. $A_1^c = \{(T, T), (T, H)\}$
5. $A_2 = \{(H, T)\}$
6. $A_2^c = \{(H, H), (T, T), (T, H)\}$
* $A_1 \cup A_2 =  \{(H, H), (H, T)\} \cup \{(H, T)\} = A_1$ 
7. $A_1 \cap A_2 =  \{(H, H), (H, T)\} \cap \{(H, T)\} = \{(H, H)\}$
8. $(A_1 \cap A_2)^c =  \{ (H, T), (T, T), (T, H)\}$
