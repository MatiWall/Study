# Quick calculation 
## 2.1
Verify that for $A_1, A_2\in \mathcal{F}$ the intersection $A_1 \cap A_2$ is also in $\mathcal{F}$
## Solution
A $\sigma$-algebra is defined as:
1. $\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty
2. if $A\in \mathcal{F}$ then $A^C\in \mathcal{F}$
3. if $A_1, A_2,\ldots \in \mathcal{F}$ then $\cup_{n=1}^{N}A_n \in \mathcal{F}$

From definition 2 we know that $A_1^C$ and $A_2^C$ are also in $\mathcal{F}$ and from 3. that $A_1^C \cup A_2^C \in \mathcal{F}$. From the De Morgan's rule we know
$$
    \cap_{n=1}^{N}A_n = \left(\cup_{n=1}^N A_n^C\right)^C
$$
we see that  $A_1 \cap A_2 \in \mathcal{F}$

# 2.2
Considering a die throw where all that matters to us is if the number on top is even or odd. The sigma algebra generated by this is $$\mathcal{F} = \{\emptyset, \{2, 4, 6\}, \{1,3,5\}, \Omega\}$$ where
$\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.
Verify that $\mathcal{F}$ is a valid $\sigma$-algebra.

**Condition 1: Non Empty** - Obviously not (Fulfilled).

**Condition 2: Complement** - Consider the even numbers $A=\{2, 4, 6\}$, $A^C$ will then be the odd numbers as seen from definition of $\Omega$ and vise versa.

**Condition 3: Countable Unions** - Say we have $A_1 = \{1, 3, 5\}$ and $A_2 = \{2,4,6\}$ the union $A_1 \cup A_2 = \Omega$ i.e. this is also in the $\sigma$-alegbra. Also any union of $A_n$ with $\emptyset$ returns $A_n$ i.e. in the set.
