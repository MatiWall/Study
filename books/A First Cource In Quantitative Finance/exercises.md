## 2.1
Consider a simplified version of the wheel of fortune as seen in the figure. Consider that the wheel is fair. Create a complete probability space as a model for one turn of the wheel

### Solution
A probability space needs a sample space $\Omega$, a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ and the probability measure $P$.
Here we have 
$$
\Omega = {1,2,3},
$$
$$
\mathcal{F}={\emptyset, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, \Omega}
$$
$$
P(\{\omega\})=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{4} & \text{for } \omega \in \{1,2\} \\
\frac{1}{2} & \text{for } \omega = 3
\end{cases}
$$

## 2.2
Calculate the natural filtration from exercise 2.1, generated by the outcome $A=\{2\}$. Does $\mathcal{F}_1 = 2^\Omega$ hold?

Before any turns the $\sigma$-algebra is
$$
\mathcal{F} = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}
$$

after the outcome $A=\{2\}$ it is
$$
\mathcal{F}_1 = \{\emptyset, \{2\}, \{1, 3\} \Omega\}
$$

Does $\mathcal{F}_1 = 2^\Omega$ hold? The generated $\mathcal{F}_1$ is a subset of the power set. $\mathcal{F}_1 = 2^\Omega$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra contaning the outcome.

## 2.3
Consider rolling a fair die with $X(\omega)$ as the number of pips and the event $A$ of throwing an even number. Show that the conditional expectation, given $A$ is greater than the unconditional expectation.

Unconditional probability measure
$$
P(\omega)=\frac{1}{6}
$$
The expectation value is given
$$
E[X] = \sum_{n=1}^6 \frac{1}{6} = \frac{21}{6} = 3.5  
$$

For the conditional probability given $A$
$$
E[X]_A = \sum_{n=1}^6 n P(X=n \mid A)=\sum_{n=1}^{6} n \frac{P(X\cap A)}{P(A)}
$$
where
$$
\frac{P(X\cap A)}{P(A)} = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{3} & \text{for n even} \\
0 & \text{for n odd}
\end{cases}
$$
using this probability measure to get
$$
E[X]_A = \sum_{n=1}^3 \frac{2n}{3} + \sum_{n=1}^{3}(2n-1)\cdot 0 = \frac{12}{3}=4
$$

## 2.4
Considering the die example of exercise 2.3. Show that the property
$$
E[X]=E[E[X\mid A]]
$$
holds for $A$ being the event of throwing an even number.

$$
E[E[X\mid A]] = E[X\mid A] P(A) + E[X\mid A^C] P(A^C) = 4 \frac{1}{2} + 3 \frac{1}{2}=\frac{7}{2}=3.5
$$
