    "# Stochastic Process\n",
    "A stochastic process is a sequence of random variables in a probability space where the index of the sequence usually has the interpretation of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are both discrete and continuous processes. the key differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Discrete\n",
    "    1. Indexing parameter is discrete (countable). i.e. you known where to start counting (positive natural numbers vs positive real number)\n",
    "    2. Each index is associated with a discrete random variable usually taking a finite or countable infinite set.\n",
    "    3. Examples could be a coin flip or the outcome of a dice roll.\n",
    "2. Continues\n",
    "    1. Indexing parameter is continuous (non countable), usually could be time.\n",
    "    2. At each index point the process is associated with random variables that can take on values from a continuous range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Granularity**: Discrete processes evolve in steps or intervals of time or space, while continuous processes evolve continuously over a range of values. In discrete processes, time is usually divided into fixed increments, while continuous processes operate with infinitesimal increments.\n",

    "**Wiener Process**: The Wiener process is a stochastic process with stationary and independent increments that are normally distributed based on the size of the increments (See notebook wiener_process)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Walk**: \n",
    "Random walks are stochastic processes that are usually defined as sums of i.i.d random variables or random vectors in Euclidean space, so they are processes that change in discrete time.\n",

    "**Bernoulli Process**\n",
    "In probability and statistics, a Bernoulli process (named after Jacob Bernoulli) is a finite or infinite sequence of binary random variables, so it is a discrete-time stochastic process that takes only two values, canonically 0 and 1.\n",

    "Depending on their mathematical properties these random processes can be grouped into various categories such as:\n",
    "* Random Walks: Sequences of steps with random increments, modeling various random phenomena.\n",
    "* Martingales: Processes where future expectations are equal to current values, often used in fair game theory.\n",
    "* Markov Processes: Memoryless processes where future states depend only on the current state.\n",
    "* Levy Processes: Processes with stationary, independent increments, including both continuous and jump components.\n",

    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic process is defined as the collections of random variables on a common probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P)$ (also known as a probability triplet) and the random variable, indexed by some set $T$, all takes values in the same space $S$ which has to be measurable with respect to some $\\sigma$- algebra $\\Sigma$.  In another way for a given probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P)$ and measurable space $(S, \\Sigma)$ is a collection of $S$ valued random variables written as $\\{X(t): t\\in T\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\sigma$-algebra: A $\\sigma$-algebra on a set $S$ is a nonempty collection $\\Sigma$ of subsets of $S$ closed under complement, countable unions and countable intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample space represents the collection of all possible outcomes of a stochastic process, while the measurable space defines which subsets of the sample space are considered \"measurable\" and can have probabilities assigned to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Difference between $\\Omega$ and $S$** \n",
    "> $\\Omega$ is the space of all outcomes of the underlying random variable i.e. the elements of $\\Omega$ are the basic outcomes that can occur. $S$ is the space in which the random variable associated with the process takes values. As an example consider a roll with a six-sided die. The sample space is $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Now let $X$ be a random variable representing the outcome of the die roll plus 10. In this case $S=\\{11,12,13,14,15,16\\}$ i.e. $\\Omega$ and $S$ are different. A random variable is a stochastic process that map outcomes from $\\Omega$ to $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability space consists of three elements:\n",
    "1. The sample space $\\Omega$, i.e. the set of all possibilities.\n",
    "2. An event space $\\mathcal{F}$, where an event is a set of outcomes in he sample space (subsets of  $\\Omega$).\n",
    "3. A probability function $P$ assigning each event with a probability (probability measure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering a standard die throw example with sample space is $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. We can choose the event space as the set of all subsets. This contains simple events such as $\\{2\\}$ i.e. the die lands on 2 and $\\{2,4,6\\}$ i.e. the die lands on an even number. The probability function then maps each of these event to a probability i.e. the number of outcomes in an event divided by the total number of outcomes int the sample space. For the event $\\{2\\}$ this is trivial as there is only a single outcome in the event space i.e. $P(\\{2\\}) = 1/6$, whereas for $\\{2,4,6\\}$ there is three outcomes i.e. $P(\\{2,4,6\\})=3/6=1/2$. Considering an experiment, we imagine that nature select a single outcome $\\omega$ from the sample space $\\Omega$. An event in the event space $\\mathcal{F}$ that contains $\\omega$ are said to have occurred. By repeating the experiment many time the probability for each event should match that assigned by $P$.\n",

    "### σ-Algebra (Sigma-Algebra)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$ over a sample space $\\Omega$ is a collection of subsets of $\\Omega$ that satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "  1. **Contains the Sample Space**: $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}$\n",
    "  2. **Closed Under Complements**: If $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $A^c = \\Omega \\setminus A \\in \\mathcal{F}$\n",
    "  3. **Closed Under Countable Unions**: If $A_1, A_2, A_3, \\ldots \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $\\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i \\in \\mathcal{F}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: For a collection of subsets $\\{A_i\\}$ of $\\Omega$, the σ-algebra $\\sigma(\\{A_i\\})$ is the smallest σ-algebra containing every set $A_i$ from the collection. It includes all possible events that can be described using the sets in $\\{A_i\\}$ through countable unions, intersections, and complements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Space**: $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n",

    "\n",
    "To find $\\sigma\\{\\{1\\}, \\{4\\}\\}$, we need to consider all possible sets formed from unions, intersections, and complements of $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{4\\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Original Sets**:\n",
    "   - $\\{1\\}$\n",
    "   - $\\{4\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complements**:\n",
    "   - $\\{1\\}^c = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Unions**:\n",
    "   - $\\{1\\} \\cup \\{4\\} = \\{1, 4\\}$\n",
    "   - $\\{1\\}^c \\cup \\{4\\}^c = \\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}$\n",

    "The $\\sigma$-algebra $\\sigma\\{\\{1\\}, \\{4\\}\\}$ contains all the events that can be determined from knowing whether a 1 or a 4 has occurred or not. This means you can describe all possible scenarios involving these sets, including their intersections, unions, and complements, which fully characterize the possible outcomes and their probabilities.\n",

    "## Probability Space\n",
    "A probability measure is a fundamental concept in probability theory and measure theory that provides a way to assign probabilities to events within a sample space. It formalizes the intuitive notion of probability and satisfies specific axioms to ensure its consistency and usefulness. Here's an explanation of a probability measure:\n",
    "1. Non-negativity: $P(A_i) \\ge 0$ for $A_i \\in \\mathcal{F}$\n",
    "2. Normalization: $P(\\Omega) = 1$\n",
    "3. Countable additive: $P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup ...) = P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)+...$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability measure - a function on $\\mathcal{F}$such that $P$ is countable additive i.e. a function mapping sets to numbers, with the property that its value on a union of two disjoint sets equal the sum of its values namely $\\{A_i\\}_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$ then $P\\left( \\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i \\right) = \\Sigma_{i=1}^{\\infty}P(A_i)$. In addition the measure of the entire sample space is equal to one i.e. $P(\\Omega) = 1$.\n"
