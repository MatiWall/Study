# Learning Stochastic Calculus for Finance

## Fundamental Topics in Stochastic Calculus
Start with the core concepts of stochastic processes and their applications in finance:
- **Brownian Motion (Wiener Process)**: Definition, properties, and paths.
- **Stochastic Processes**: Definition, types (e.g., Markov processes, martingales), and basic properties.
- **Itô Calculus**: 
  - Itô's Lemma
  - Stochastic integrals
  - Itô processes

## Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
Learn how to model financial systems using SDEs:
- **Formulation of SDEs**: Understanding the components (drift and diffusion terms).
- **Solving SDEs**: Methods to find solutions (analytical and numerical techniques).
- **Applications in Finance**: Modeling stock prices (Geometric Brownian Motion), interest rates, and other financial quantities.

## Risk-Neutral Valuation
Understand the fundamental concepts of risk-neutral valuation, which is crucial for derivative pricing:
- **Change of Measure**: Girsanov's theorem and the Radon-Nikodym derivative.
- **Martingale Measures**: Understanding equivalent martingale measures (EMM) and their role in pricing.

## Financial Derivatives Pricing
Dive into the specific methods used to price different types of financial derivatives:
- **Black-Scholes Model**: Derivation, assumptions, and applications for European options.
- **Exotic Options**: Pricing and hedging of path-dependent and other complex options.
- **Interest Rate Models**: Short-rate models (Vasicek, CIR), Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework.
- **Numerical Methods**: Monte Carlo simulations, finite difference methods, and binomial/trinomial trees.

## Advanced Topics
Once you have a strong grasp of the basics, you can explore more advanced topics:
- **Jump Diffusion Models**: Incorporating jumps into price models (e.g., Merton's model).
- **Stochastic Volatility Models**: Heston model and other volatility models.
- **Credit Risk Models**: Modeling and pricing credit derivatives.
- **Optimal Control and Portfolio Theory**: Merton's portfolio problem, dynamic programming.

## Understanding the Stock and Bond Market (Should be in another part)
- **Stock Market Basics**: 
  - How stocks are traded
  - Stock indices
  - Market participants
  - Fundamental and technical analysis
- **Bond Market Basics**:
  - Types of bonds (government, corporate, municipal)
  - Bond pricing
  - Yield curves
  - Credit ratings and risk
