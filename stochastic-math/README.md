## Fundamental Topics in Stochastic Calculus
Start with the core concepts of stochastic processes and their applications in finance:
- **Stochastic Processes**: Definition, types (e.g., Markov processes, martingales), and basic properties.
- **Brownian Motion (Wiener Process)**: Definition, properties, and paths.

## Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
Learn how to model financial systems using SDEs:
- **Formulation of SDEs**: Understanding the components (drift and diffusion terms).
- **Solving SDEs**: Methods to find solutions (analytical and numerical techniques).
- **Applications in Finance**: Modeling stock prices (Geometric Brownian Motion), interest rates, and other financial quantities.
- **Fourier Transformations**: Applications in solving differential equations and in finance.

## Stochastic Integrals
Explore the concept of stochastic integrals, which are central to stochastic calculus and SDEs:
- **Definition of Stochastic Integrals**: 
  - Introduction to integrals with respect to Brownian motion (It么 integrals).
- **Properties of Stochastic Integrals**: 
  - Linearity, isometry, and other fundamental properties.
- **Construction of Stochastic Integrals**: 
  - Step processes and the extension to more general processes.
- **Martingale Representation Theorem**: 
  - Every martingale can be represented as a stochastic integral with respect to Brownian motion.
- **Integration with respect to Semimartingales**: 
  - Extending the concept of stochastic integrals to semimartingales, which includes Brownian motion and other processes.
